## Spatial Pyramid Matching for Scene Classification

The code provided in this repository was the result of a homework assignment in which I built a representation based on bags of visual words and used spatial pyramid matching for classifying scene categories. I completely developed each of these files, with exception to opts.py and util.py. These two files were written by those who designed the homework assignment at CMU.

See [this](https://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/publications/pyramid_chapter.pdf) for a resource on spatial pyramid matching.
