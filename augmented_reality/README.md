## Augmented Reality Using Planar Homographies

This directory contains code from a homework assignment in which I implemented an augmented reality (AR) application using planar homographies. A homography is effectively a mapping between two projective spaces that correspond to two different camera views of a point on a plane. The idea surrounding this assignment was to map a video onto a particular plane in a moving frame. I have ommitted the data associated with generating the result, but the following was generated using the ```ar.py``` file.
